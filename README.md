# FullContact_JavaExample
Just an example of the use of the FullContact API with the Java language.

Do not use for production project. Use this example only for academic purposes.

## Usage
There is a jar file in the out/artifacts/Contact_Finder_jar folder. Execute this jar file with 'java -jar "Contact Finder.jar"' to execute the main program.

We will push updates as often as we can.

Thanks. Any comment is welcome.
